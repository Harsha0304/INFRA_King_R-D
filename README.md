## Project Overview

The **INFRA-KING DevOps Platform** is designed to help teams efficiently manage cloud resources while automating key aspects of the DevOps lifecycle. This platform is capable of provisioning infrastructure, handling CI/CD processes, monitoring system performance, and optimizing cloud resource costs using AI.

### The primary goals of this project:
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Use **Terraform** to provision and manage cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate build, test, and deployment processes using **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI/CD**, or **CircleCI**.
- **Container Orchestration**: Manage containers and microservices using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- **Cloud Cost Optimization**: Use **AI Copilot** to manage and optimize cloud costs, ensuring efficient usage of resources.

## Features

- **Full DevOps Automation**: From infrastructure provisioning to CI/CD and deployment.
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Supports AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud providers.
- **Terraform Integration**: Automate provisioning of cloud resources.
- **Kubernetes & Docker**: Orchestrate and manage containerized applications.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Real-time monitoring, metrics collection, and visualization.
- **AI-powered Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize cloud costs with AI Copilot.
- **Auto-scaling**: Scalable infrastructure based on resource demand.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified about system health and potential issues.

## Tech Stack

The **INFRA-KING DevOps Platform** uses a combination of open-source tools and cloud-native services to automate and manage the DevOps pipeline. Here is a list of core technologies used in this project:

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning cloud resources.
- **Docker** – Containerization for microservices and applications.
- **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration for managing microservices.
- **Prometheus** – Monitoring and alerting system for collecting metrics.
- **Grafana** – Data visualization platform for monitoring dashboards.
- **AI Copilot** – AI-driven tool for cloud cost optimization.
- **Jenkins / GitLab CI/CD / CircleCI** – CI/CD pipelines to automate code deployment and testing.

## Use Case

The **INFRA-KING DevOps Platform** is perfect for:
- **DevOps Engineers** who want to automate infrastructure management, CI/CD, and monitoring across multiple cloud platforms.
- **Software Developers** who want faster and more reliable application deployment.
- **Cloud Architects** who aim to optimize cloud resource usage and costs while maintaining scalability.
- **Tech Startups and Companies** looking to automate operations and reduce manual overhead.
- **System Administrators** who need to monitor and scale infrastructure effectively.

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular approach using several key components:
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Managed by Terraform, this handles the creation of cloud resources like EC2, S3, RDS, etc.
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Managed using Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI. Code from Git repositories is automatically built, tested, and deployed.
3. **Containers and Orchestration**: Docker containers are orchestrated using Kubernetes for scaling and managing microservices.
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus collects system and application metrics, and Grafana visualizes these metrics in real-time dashboards.
5. **Cost Optimization**: The AI Copilot continuously monitors resource usage and suggests cost-saving actions to optimize cloud spending.

### Example Workflow:
1. Code is pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. The CI/CD pipeline runs to build and test the application.
3. Docker containers are built and pushed to a registry.
4. Kubernetes is used to deploy the containers into a cloud environment.
5. Prometheus collects monitoring data and sends it to Grafana for visualization.
6. The AI Copilot suggests actions to reduce cloud costs based on usage patterns.
